### Problem Statement

Build a responsive front end UI.

- Treat the assignment as a task to produce a production-shippable product.
- As well as being responsive and intuitive, the solution should demonstrate an understanding of best practices and good software design.
- Unit and functional tests should be included in your implementation.

Please use Github as your VCS solution. We will be looking at your use of commits and understanding version control best practices.

#### API

Design and implement a frontend component that allows you to call and consume an open API (Eventbrite, Guardian, Weather) then use the data to render a UI on a mobile application.

#### End user

Consider how a typical mobile user would use the app in your design and structure your UI to be responsive when displayed on different devices.
The front end component should include a form that allows the user to enter an input which impacts what is called from the API.

- On submit should render results in an appropriate way (e.g. with pagination where the number of responses exceeds what can be shown on the screen).
- We would like to see your eye for design so try to make it look as good as possible and make sure that it gives the user a good experience.
  Bonus points for inline validation and code reuse.
