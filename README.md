### Problem Statement

Build a responsive front end UI.

- Treat the assignment as a task to produce a production-shippable product.
- As well as being responsive and intuitive, the solution should demonstrate an understanding of best practices and good software design.
- Unit and functional tests should be included in your implementation.

#### API

Design and implement a frontend component that allows you to call and consume an open API, then use the data to render a UI on a mobile application.

This project has used: 

- WeatherAPI
- Postcodes.io API

#### End user

Consider how a typical mobile user would use the app in your design and structure your UI to be responsive when displayed on different devices.

- The front end component should include a form that allows the user to enter an input which impacts what is called from the API.
- On submit, should render results in an appropriate way (e.g. with pagination where the number of responses exceeds what can be shown on the screen).
